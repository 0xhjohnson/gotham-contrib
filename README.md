Gotham is a very dark colorscheme. It was build for vim, and this [iTerm
2][iterm2] version is for using it with terminal vim. It works in iTerm without
vim too.

Here's an iTerm only screenshot:

## Installation

[Download][zipped] the repository, unzip it and double-click on the
`Gotham.itermcolors` file. iTerm will confirm the colorscheme has been
installed.

Now go into `Preferences > Profiles > Colors` and select `Gotham` from the
`Color Presets...` menu.

You're done!

#### Vim

If you use vim, [vim-gotham][vim-gotham] is the vim version of the Gotham
colorscheme. Details and installation instructions for vim are available in the
vim-gotham repository.
